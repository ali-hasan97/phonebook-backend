# phonebook-backend
Simple phonebook app created using the MERN stack. Currently unstyled.

It lets users add a name and a number to the phonebook, which is searchable. Data can also be updated if a duplicate name is added with a unique number. All entries are stored in a MongoDB database. Displays success/failure messages on all requests.
